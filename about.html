<img class="inline" src="./assets/images/sxsw.jpg">Power pop-punk outfit Rozwell Kid began in 2011 as the solo project of West Virginia native Jordan Hudkins. While drumming for fellow West Virginians the Demon Beat, Hudkins began assembling his own album based on his love of '90s punk and post-grunge indie. Signing with Broken World Media to release his debut, The Rozwell Kid LP, Hudkins assembled a full-band lineup that included guitarist Adam L. Meisterhans, bassist Devin Donnelly, and drummer Sean Hallock. With a sound resembling the tuneful fuzz pop of early Weezer, the band proceeded to deliver two more albums for the label in 2013's Unmacho and 2014's Too Shabby, each one tighter than the last. Over subsequent tours, festival appearances, split singles, and EPs, Rozwell Kid's reputation grew, eventually bringing them to the attention of revered California indie SideOneDummy, who signed them in 2017. Precious Art, their debut for the label and fourth album overall, was released in June of that year.
